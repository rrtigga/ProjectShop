# ProjectShop

This was an android app whipped up at the Shirts IO Hackathon in San Francisco. This android app essentially is a marketplace to fund creative projects in your local community. Users can go in and buy a shirt from a distinct seller. It can be anyone from entrepreneur, student, business, or any citizen. After the user buys the shirt, they get a token that can be used to fund projects. Users that post projects for funding can redeem the tokens for money.
